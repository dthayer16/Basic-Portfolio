        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/Slack_Profile_Photo.jpg" alt="David Thayer" class="profile">
        <p>My name is David Thayer and I am an aspiring Web Developer! Previously I worked for companies such as
            Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Vanguard, and Farmers Insurance. While I have not had any direct Web Development
            experience with these companies I always displayed a hunger for learning and volunteered for working on
            pilots for new technologies. I know that my previous experience in working with new programs and studying
            for various licensing exams has set me up for success to excel in my Web Development Bootcamp.</p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy watching sports, exercise, and spending time out and about with my friends. My
            enthusiasm for sports and exercise come from my playing baseball at Hastings College the four years I
            attended school there. I also enjoy music, movies, and TV shows. Some of my favorite musical artisits
            include Dierks Bentley, The Chainsmokers, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sublim, Queen, and Chance The Rapper. I
            am a big fan of the Marvel movie franchise and still go to the "midnight" showing of all of their new
            movies. Three of my favorite TV Shows are Psych, Letterkenny, and How I Met Your Mother.</p>
